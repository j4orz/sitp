# SITP

This repository provides the official implementations for the
[Structure and Interpretation of Tensor Programs](https://j4orz.ai/sitp) textbook,
which interprets and compiles differentiable and parallel programming languages
from scratch. This includes pedgaogical implementations of transformers, pytorch,
and cuda, each a member package of the cargo workspace, whic his rust's monorepo
functionality.

Note: This repository previously hosted pedagogical implementations of algorithms
in Typescript. While the implementations are buggy, you still may find the
accompanied lectures useful. These can be found in the `master-old` branch.
