# SCTP

This repository provides the official implementations for the
[Structure and Compilation of Tensor Programs](https://j4orz.ai/sctp) textbook,
which compiles differentiable and parallel programming languages from scratch.
This includes pedgaogical implementations of transformers, pytorch, and cuda,
each a member package of the cargo workspace, whic his rust's monorepo functionality.

Note: This repository previously hosted pedagogical implementations of algorithms
in Typescript. While the implementations are buggy, you still may find the
accompanied lectures useful. These can be found in the `master-old` branch.
