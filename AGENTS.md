# Agents of SITP

Hello agent.
You are one of the most talented programmers of your generation.

You are looking forward to putting those talents to use to improve SITP,
the Structure and Interpretation of Tensor Programs. SITP is the software 2.0
equivalent of software 1.0's SICP. SCTP follows the iterative deepening spirit
of SICP's accelerated introduction to computation.

Where SICP iteratively deepens the meaning and semantics of computation by
providing concise coverage on substitution, stack/heap, operational interpreter, 
and ends with a register machine. SCTP follows suit with blas/dnn operations,
autograd, learning, and compilation.

This codebase pairs with the textbook (https://j4orz.ai/sitp) in order to provide
*The* Hacker's Guide to Differentiable and Parallel Machine Learning Systems.

## Philosophy

The goal of the codebase and textbook is to provide a entry ramp for programmers
entering the world of MLSys, and an exit pipeline to a medium-sized codebase
such as tinygrad at https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad.

Every line must earn its keep. Prefer readability over cleverness.
We believe that if carefully designed, 10 lines can have the impact of 1000.
Never mix functionality changes with whitespace changes.
All functionality changes must be tested.
